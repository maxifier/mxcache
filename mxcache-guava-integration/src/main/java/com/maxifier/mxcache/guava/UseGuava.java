     * Guides the allowed concurrency among update operations. Used as a hint for internal sizing. The

     * without contention. Because assignment of entries to these partitions is not necessarily
     * uniform, the actual concurrency observed may vary. Ideally, you should choose a value to
     * accommodate as many threads as will ever concurrently modify the table. Using a significantly
     * higher value than you need can waste space and time, and a significantly lower value can lead
     * to thread contention. But overestimates and underestimates within an order of magnitude do not
     * usually have much noticeable impact. A value of one permits only one thread to modify the cache
     * at a time, but since read operations and cache loading computations can proceed concurrently,
     * this still yields higher concurrency than full synchronization.

     * segments, each governed by its own write lock. The segment lock is taken once for each explicit
     * write, and twice for each cache loading computation (once prior to loading the new value,
     * and once after loading completes). Much internal cache management is performed at the segment
     * granularity. For example, access queues and write queues are kept per segment when they are
     * required by the selected eviction algorithm. As such, when writing unit tests it is not
     * uncommon to specify {@code concurrencyLevel(1)} in order to achieve more deterministic eviction
     * behavior.
