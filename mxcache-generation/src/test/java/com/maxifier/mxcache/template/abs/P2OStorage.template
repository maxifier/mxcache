 * <p>
 * This is a basic implementation of cache storage. It is very similar to a usual map.
 * It supports two main operations: load and save for corresponding key and value types.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are no storages with primitive value types due to the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>using object as value allows to store special marker-values (UNDEFINED, exceptions, etc.) without an overhead;
 * </li>
 * <li>it simplifies the code: you don't need to have a separate 'isCalculated(key)' method.</li>
 * </ul>
